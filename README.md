## üå©Ô∏è 1. Understanding the Basics ‚Äì Public Cloud Concepts

### üîπ What Is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the **delivery of computing services over the internet (‚Äúthe cloud‚Äù)** instead of owning physical hardware or data centers.

These services include:

* **Servers**
* **Storage**
* **Databases**
* **Networking**
* **Software**
* **Analytics**
* **AI/ML services**, etc.

Cloud computing allows organizations to:

* **Scale quickly**
* **Reduce costs**
* **Increase flexibility**
* **Pay only for what they use**

### üîπ Cloud Deployment Models

| Deployment Model  | Description                                                                                                     | Example                                                                   |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Public Cloud**  | Services offered over the internet to anyone who wants to buy them. Owned and managed by third-party providers. | AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** |
| **Private Cloud** | Dedicated to a single organization; may be hosted on-premises or by a provider.                                 | VMware Cloud, OpenStack                                                   |
| **Hybrid Cloud**  | Combines both public and private clouds for flexibility.                                                        | Azure Arc, Oracle Cloud@Customer                                          |
| **Multi-Cloud**   | Using services from multiple cloud providers.                                                                   | Using AWS + OCI + Azure together                                          |

### üîπ Cloud Service Models

| Service Model                          | Description                                                              | Example                                         |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)** | Provides virtualized computing resources (servers, storage, networking). | OCI Compute, Amazon EC2, Azure Virtual Machines |
| **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**       | Provides a platform for building, testing, and deploying apps.           | Oracle Autonomous Database, Google App Engine   |
| **SaaS (Software as a Service)**       | Ready-to-use software applications over the internet.                    | Gmail, Oracle Fusion Cloud Apps, Salesforce     |
